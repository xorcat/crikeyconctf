# Welcome!

Oh hi!  Thanks for visiting our little site.   So...whats the deal?

We wanted a way to be able to give out information on CrikeyCon's CTF, prior to the con, as well as place where we might be able to put up writeups etc afterwards too.   So...here we are.

There will be various FAQ's etc, and hopefully we'll keep adding to the site, so bear (hehe...Bear...as in Droppy....get it...........WHATEVER!) with us while we keep adding content.


# More Info
On the day, come into the CTF room (or anywhere around the venue) and find the "CrikeyCTF" wireless network. Join it with he top secure password of "crikeyctf" and browse to the [CTF Scoreboard](https://ctf.crikeycon.com) (This will be different on the network on the day than this site).  Register on the website (you can put in a fake email address, we don't use em) and then either register a team or join an existing one.

Once registered and the CTF starts, challenges will be listed.  Click on them try and solve it and find the flag.  Pretty much all flags are in the format of flag{example_flag}.

We will have limited internet on the network, but if you need any "BIG" files, please first check our [Files Server](http://files.crikey.ctf) on the network..  On there should be ISO's and VM's for Kali etc, wordlists you may need, and other tools that would be useful (e.g Burp Suite, VMWare Player, VirtualBox etc)

If you have ANY other questions or concerns, come find a member of the CTF crew, we'll be sat behind the main CTF Admin desk pulling our hair out trying to fix DNS issues again.

This year we have brought back some previous years challenges, mainly because we know we have more new people coming to CrikeyCon, and want them to play them too, and hopefully learn something.

# FAQs
### What is a CTF?
For a great explanation check out [CTFd.io - Whats A CTF](https://ctfd.io/whats-a-ctf/).

### When is CrikeyConCTF? (2019)
CrikeyConCTF 2019 will take place at CrikeyCon 2019 on April 6th-7th 2019, in Brisbane, QLD, Australia.

### Will the CTF be playable online?
No, the CTF is only available on the CTF wireless network at CrikeyCon.### How much will it cost to play the CTF?
$25 a player........naa, course not (good idea though).  It's free!

### What skill level is CrikeyConCTF?
CrikeyConCTF has always been a "beginner" level CTF, we always have challenges for the more skilled players, and we hope to keep them entertained.  But CrikeyConCTF is aimed for people who've never played a CTF before, and beginners who are just getting started.  We want people to go away having learned something, even if it's 1 thing.

### What category of challenges will there be?
* Web
* Crypto
* Exploit
* Devices (We have some vulnerable devices, with known exploits.  Can you find them and pop them for the flag?)
* Binaries
* Trivia
* GRC Trivia
* etc.  There will be a wide range.

### I'm a good CTF player, but before i play i want to know what the prizes will be?
Naaa, this CTF ain't for you.  We want people to have fun, and learn something.  Sure everyone loves a winner, but if thats your main focus, you won't enjoy this CTF.

Having said that, we will have prizes, donated by our awesome sponsors OzHackm, PenTesterLab and BSidesBrisbane.
We give away prizes and trophys to the top 3 teams, but also give away random prizes throughout the CTF.  Basically we will pick a point during the game, watch the log for incoming correct flags and the next team to submit, wins the prize.  This means, ANYONE can win a prize, just by playing the CTF.

Prizes for this year include:
* 3 & 6 month vouchers from the awesome [PenTesterLab](https://pentesterlab.com/) (Also come get a free sticker from the CTF table)
* Various hacker tools from our sponsor since our first ever CTF [OZHack](https://ozhack.com/)
* Tickets to the inaugural [BSidesBrisbane](https://bsidesbrisbane.com/)
* Tickets to NEXT years CrikeyCon (Oh god, we can't be considering that yet can we?)
* The most AWESOME of trophies to compete againest last years Chicken, Cheerleaders and ...was it darts or snooker players trophies.

### I've NEVER played a CTF before, but keen to play, what will i need?
Awesome, this CTF is for you.  The main thing you'll need is a laptop.  The scoreboard and most of the challenges should be accessible on a mobile phone, but you may need certain tools to solve challenges you'll probably need a laptop to run.
We suggest you either run Kali Linux on your laptop, or run it in a Virtual Machine on your laptop.  It has the majority of the tools you'll need.  If you've never set this up before, come see a member of the CTF crew and we should be able to help you get setup.

If you don't have a laptop, or don't want to bring one, we do have 4 "loaner" laptops which will be setup, running Kali Linux on a USB stick.  Please use them, and once done, give them a reboot so anything you've done gets removed.

So...you have a laptop, you have Kali.  Find a seat in the CTF room (or anywhere else round the venue) and connect to the "CrikeyCTF" wireless network which should be available.  The password for the wireless network is "crikeyctf".
Once connected browse to https://ctf.crikeycon.com and you'll get to the scoreboard, register as a player, and register a team or join an existing one with friends.  Once registered and logged in, click on the "Challenges" andf start playing!

### What are the rules of playing the CTF?
Please read the rules listed here:

* Don't be a dick.  Yeah yeah, very generic, but basically if you you're thinking of doing something that some people may think is wrong or stupid etc.  Please don't.
* Don't attack the CTF infrastructure.  We spend a LOT of time working hard to create challenges for players, so hopefully they are challenged, have fun and learn something.  We try our best to secure the infrastucture (Wireless, Scoreboard, Servers etc) but it's not our main focus, thats on challenges.   Just please don't, if you do "pop us" we won't be impressed, we'll think you're pretty much breaking this rule and rule 1 above.
* Don't attack other players.   They aren't here to be hacked or have their day spoiled, hopefully they wanna have fun and learn something, without the fear of nasty things happening to them on the network.  Please don't.
* No Menz's - Goes without saying.
* Maximum number of players per team.  This is hard, and pretty much impossible to control, but we'd prefer teams of no more than 4-6.  If you have more than that in your crew, split into 2 different teams and compete againest each other.

### Is it safe to play the CTF/join the CTF network?
Well...hopefully, yes, it's safe.  But you are on a hostile network, there are other hackers on there, but hopefully everyone abides by the Rules, including not attacking other players.  We hope it doesn't happen, but idiots will be idiots sometimes.  If you do think someones doing something they shouldn't please let a member of the CTF crew immediatly so we can investigate.
